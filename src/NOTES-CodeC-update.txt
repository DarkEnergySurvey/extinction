A few c files and the Makefile had to be modified to make sure that it
compiled on OS X 10.8 and Linux x86_64. Here is a description of the
changes. You can see the file: CodeC.patch for the specfic changes. 

Felipe Menanteau, NCSA, Nov 2013.

- The code was debugged with gdb

1) In subs_common_string.h comment out the definition for 'getline'
2) In subs_inoutput.h increase from 80 to 256 the variables
MAX_FILE_NAME_LEN  and  IO_FORTRAN_FL 
3) In subs_fits.c change pLabel_temp[8] to pLabel_temp[9] to avoid
Abort
4) In Makefile add CFLAGS =  -O2 -D__OSX -arch i386 -arch x86_64
-DLITTLE_ENDIAN to compile on OSX.

- Finally create a patch for all of the chages
%> diff -rupN CodeC CodeC_FMupdate > CodeC.patch 

- Apply the patch
%> cd CodeC
%> patch --dry-run -b -p 1 -id   # Dry run
%> patch -b -p 1 -id             # For real
%> mv CodeC CodeC_DESDMpatched   # change name
%> tar cvf CodeC_DESDMpatched.tar CodeC_DESDMpatched # tar up
