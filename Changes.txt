version 1.0.0
--------------

- Now the SFD98 CodeC is part of a different module that it is loaded
  via EUPS previously.

- The functions in coords and tableio are now called from despyastro,
  and are not carried anymore inside the python/ directory

- bin/compute_SFD98_coadd_objects.py now creates/clobber the table
  (input) before writing, if a tableName is given in the command line.
